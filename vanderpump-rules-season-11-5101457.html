The show was flipped upside down when&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tom Sandoval</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>‘ <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>months-long affair</a> was exposed to everyone, including Tom’s girlfriend of nine years, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>, in March 2023. In turn, Bravo started rolling cameras again to capture the fallout, which was featured in the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shocking season 10 finale</a> that aired May 17. The cast later sat down with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy Cohen </strong></a>on March 23 for the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>3-part reunion</a> that kicked off in May. In the aftermath of all the drama, Bravo unsurprisingly gave the green light for Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;season 11.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>There’s so much anticipation for the next season of&nbsp;VPR following the Scandoval. It <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was announced at BravoCon</a> that the show will return in January. On December 11, Bravo released <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the trailer</a> for season 11 and confirmed the show returns January 30.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span>Will There Be A Vanderpump Rules Season 11?</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Yes,&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;will be back for season 11. The show’s renewal was confirmed by Bravo on May 9. Bravo also ordered more episodes of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives</a>&nbsp;franchises,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Below Deck</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Southern Charm</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Million Dollar Listing</a>, and more shows. The season officially began filming at the end of June. Season 11 will premiere on January 30.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Executive producer <strong>Alex Baskin&nbsp;</strong>addressed the next season of the show in an interview with&nbsp;Variety. “No one’s saying no, I’ll say that — but I think it’s hard for anybody to say yes right now, because they feel like they haven’t gotten any reprieve,” Alex said. He also explained why Bravo<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> didn’t rush into filming season 11</a>. “The reunion is not just a recap of what you know, and it’s not just an intense version of the emotions. There is new information,” he shared before all three parts of the reunion aired. “I will put it this way: There are revelations, and they are revelations that not all of them know now. So we need a little space. I had thought that we needed cameras on them right away. And I now think we need a minute.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Alex confirmed to&nbsp;Variety&nbsp;that the show would start filming summer 2023. “It’s definitely a balancing act, because we don’t want too much time to elapse,” he said. “We can also, as we’ve proven, get cameras up if we need to. If Tom and Ariana happen to move, we’re up. But, I think that we need enough time to pass that we’re not just caught in this vortex.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>When asked by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;on June 6 about when filming would pick up again, Alex said, “Our hope and plan is in the not-too-distant future this summer. So, in the next few weeks.” And he was right. On June 26, while&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>livestreaming via Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lala Kent</strong></a> revealed that production on season 11 would start on June 28, 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“We start filming on Wednesday, and it’s giving me anxiety,” Lala said. “I’m just like, ‘Oh, we’re really in it again.’ We usually have so much time to process — things change a lot — but nope. This is the first time it was: ‘Film a season. Oh wait, something really crazy happened. Pick back up cameras. Here’s nine episodes to watch by tomorrow, before the reunion.

Kristen filmed again after the scandal broke and her scenes were featured in the finale. But Kristen said on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Viall</strong>‘s podcast</a> that she isn’t interested in appearing on the show in a full-time capacity again. “I don’t want to be a part of anything that has ‘Vanderpump’ attached to it. I’m good on that,” she said. “I have outgrown them. I still have my friends, but that’s a toxic environment that I will gain nothing from.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>There was also speculation that Jax<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and his wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brittany Cartwright</a>&nbsp;</strong>would return for season 11 in a full-time capacity. The couple <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>weighed in</a> on ‘Scandoval’ and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>watched some of the episodes</a> for a feature on Peacock. Brittany appeared on&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong>‘s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pay Attention Puh-Lease! podcast</a> and hinted that she and Jax <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>may come back to the show</a>, after they were <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fired</a> in 2020. “We’re definitely a lot more open to it now than we would’ve been,” Brittany said. “Us having a break from reality TV was really good for our marriage, I think. We’re kind of getting back into the flow of things. So if it’s right for our family, we would definitely be open to it. We definitely are open to other things, too. So we’ll see.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Brittany also said in the interview it “would be fun” to return to the show with Jax. “That was a huge part of my life and Jax’s life especially for so long,” Brittany explained. “There were some bad moments, but there were also some amazing moments. The wedding and our engagement and all that stuff was on the show as well, so I have to remember that and how much fun I had.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/‘Vanderpump-Rules-Season-11-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Alex Baskin hinted to Variety&nbsp;that there’s a chance alums could return to the show for season 11. “This is not a show that you can plug an outsider into,” he said. “So we definitely have those conversations.

Instead, they’re filming a new spinoff show with a different group of friends, most of whom have children, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>&nbsp;reported in June 2023. The spinoff show has yet to be confirmed by Bravo.</p><h2>Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;Season 11 Trailer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>The&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;season 11 trailer was released by Bravo on December 11.

Tom<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> filmed the upcoming season</a> with the other cast members, including Ariana, while Raquel did not. Tom was seen <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>getting into a screaming match</a> with Scheana outside SUR on July 11 while cameras were rolling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/vanderpump-rules-season-11-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-27>Raquel totally vanished from the public eye for a few months after the scandal broke. In the middle of April, she <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>checked into a mental health treatment center</a> in Arizona, according to a statement from her rep. Raquel’s rep told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a> that the reality star planned to seek help before her secret relationship with Tom was exposed. “Raquel and her family decided before the relationship was discovered that she would enter a voluntary facility for mental health counseling,” the statement read. Raquel’s rep also specified that the treatment was not a “rehab” but instead a “mental health and trauma therapy” program.</p><p id=content-paragraph-28>Raquel <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>addressed her future on the show</a> in her one-on-one interview with Andy during Peacock’s extended version of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Part 2</a> of the reunion. “I don’t know. It is in question right now. I want to,” Raquel said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/vanderpump-rules-season-11-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-29>After checking out of the mental health facility following a two month stay, Raquel went on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bethenny Frankel</strong>‘s podcast</a> on August 16 and confirmed she was done with Vanderpump Rules. “The network is running to the bank — like, laughing, running to the bank with this scandal — and I haven’t seen a single penny,” Raquel said on the podcast. She added, “It’s not fair. And I feel like a toddler saying, ‘It’s not fair.’ But it really isn’t. And I feel like I’ve been portrayed as the ultimate villain. My mistakes that I’ve made on camera live on forever. And you mentioned something about the addiction of doing reality TV and the way that they always dangle that carrot in front of you, like, ‘Well, you need to tell your side of the story otherwise it’s gonna be written for you.’ And that’s terrifying. So I almost went back, I know just because of that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-30>Most of the&nbsp;VPR&nbsp;cast weighed in on how they think filming would work for season 11, amidst their estranged relationships with Tom and Raquel. Ariana told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a> that she <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>will not film</a> with Tom and Raquel for the next season. “I have nothing to say to either of them. Our show is very real and follows a real group of friends, and neither of them are in the group of friends, so, good luck,” she said. When she appeared on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today With Hoda & Jenna</a>, Ariana explained that she has no “control” over Raquel and Tom coming back. “That’s not up to me. I can’t control any of that. I have no interest in speaking to either of them. I don’t have anything to say,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-31>Scheana admitted in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a> that “it’s going to be very hard to convince any of us [the cast] to be in the same room.” The “Good as Gold” singer told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a> that she “can picture” the whole group filming together again, but she “can’t envision what type of event that would be at.” Scheana added, “It would have to be something Lisa Vanderpump hosts. They’re not getting invited to any birthday parties, that’s for sure.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/vanderpump-rules-season-11-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-32>Lala said on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sofia With an F podcast</a> in late April that producers contacted the cast about how they feel filming with Raquel and Tom again. “I was never close with these two, I’ve never liked these two, so it wasn’t some tremendous loss,” Lala explained. “It’s actually a gain for me ’cause I finally don’t have to pretend to get along with them for the sake of the group.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-33>Lisa Vanderpump expressed doubt at how the full cast could continue together when she was at the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>White House Correspondents Association Dinner</a> on April 29. “Right now it’s a mess. I don’t know if we can sort it out,” Lisa told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">With the cast so divided, EP Alex Baskin addressed how the group can move forward when most of the don’t want to film with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tom and Raquel</a>. “The cast knows that those conditional demands never work,” Alex told THR. “So I don’t think it’s a matter of that. It’s a matter of dialing in what is organic for the group to be together, what makes sense. And knowing we want to see where they go from here. It can’t be a show with separate islands. That doesn’t work and it’s not exciting if we have groups who agree with each other but never interact.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Alex continued, “But the cast does have the full expectation that we intend to make another season of Vanderpump Rules. Not that we want to make a show that doesn’t resemble one we’ve made for all these years. It’s a show that has followed this group through everything they’ve been through to date, and we’ll see them as they continue to move forward. There still are a ton of ties between people who have incredibly strained relations right now; Tom and Ariana still live together. So even seeing how that resolves is of interest. It isn’t like all of a sudden they have gone to their respective ends of the universe and that’s it. So there’s a lot for us to cover and genuinely we have no idea how it’s going to play out, just like we wouldn’t have been able to predict any of this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9WapZ2doqXCrryMq6ylnaNiwKat0qilZmlhYoJyfJBtbHBn</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fvanderpump-rules-season-11-5101457.html&title=The%20Trailer%2c%20Premiere%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%20Hollywood%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-season-11-5101457.html&description=The%20Trailer%2c%20Premiere%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%20Hollywood%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-season-11-5101457.html&title=The%20Trailer%2c%20Premiere%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%20Hollywood%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-season-11-5101457.html&title=The%20Trailer%2c%20Premiere%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%20Hollywood%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-season-11-5101457.html&text=The%20Trailer%2c%20Premiere%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%20Hollywood%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-season-11-5101457.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Aldo Pusey</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-03-03</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./who-is-sander-jennings-dating.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Who is Sander Jennings Dating Now</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./the-big-bang-theory-fans-expose-plot-hole-with-sheldons-coopers-famous-spot-on-the-sofa.html><h3>The Big Bang Theory fans expose plot hole with Sheldons Coopers famous spot on the sofa >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
